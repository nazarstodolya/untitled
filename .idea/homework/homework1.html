<h1>Favourite actor - <b>Mads Mikkelsen</b></h1>
<p><b>Mads Mikkelsen's</b> great successes parallel those achieved by the Danish film industry since the mid-1990s. He
    was born in Ã˜sterbro, Copenhagen, to Bente Christiansen, a nurse, and Henning Mikkelsen, a banker.
    Starting out as a low-life pusher/junkie in the 1996 success "Pusher" (1996), he slowly grew to become one of
    Denmark's biggest movie actors.

<h2>Why he is the one of the greatest?</h2>
<p>The biggest impression on me was made by his role in serial <b>Hannibal</b>. Incredible charisma, refined acting and
    total immersion in the role of the main character.</p>
